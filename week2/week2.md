# Week 2: Specific Factors Model

## Intuition
Trade has substantial effects on the income distribution within each trading nation, because: 
- In the short run, some factors are mobile across industries, while others are immobile. 
- Industries differ in the factors of production they demand.

## Assumptions:

- Two goods: Manufatures (M) and Food(F)

- Three factors of production: : labour (L), capital (K) and land (T)

- Manufacturing sector employs $K$ and $L_M$ Food sector employs $T$ and $L_F$


    **Production Functions:**

    $Q_M = F(K, L_M)$ where $Q_M$ is the output for manufatures, $K$ is the economy's capital stock and $L_M$ is the labour used to produce manufacturing.

    $Q_F = F(T, L_F)$ where $Q_F$ is the output for manufatures, $T$ is the economy's land stock and $L_F$ is the labour used to produce food.

- Labour is a mobile factor across sectors: $L_M + L_F = L$

- L is exogenous, but $L_M$ and $L_F$ are endogenous

- Diminishing marginal products for factors of production

- Perfect competition prevails in all markets.
