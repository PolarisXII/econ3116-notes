# Week 1: Comparative Advantage and the Ricardian Model


## Concepts Definition:

- **Marginal product of labour (MPL)**: the amount of output produced by an additional worker.

- **Absolute Advantage**: A country has an absolute advantage in a sector if it can produce a greater
output of that sector using the same amount of resources

- **Opportunity Cost**: The opportunity cost of an unit of cheese is the amount of wine that could be
produced using the same resources.

- **Comparative Advantage**: A country has a comparative advantage in producing a good if it has a lower opportunity cost of producing that good than other countries.

## Autarky:

Consider the following assumptions:
- 2 goods: Cheese and Wine.
- 1 factor: Labour.
- The labour productivity is fixed and labour is mobile across industries.

The **production functions** of cheese and wine can be expressed as: 
- Q~c~ = $\frac{L~c~}{a~Lc~}$
- Q~w~ = $\frac{L~w~}{a~Lw~}$

where a~Lc~ and a~Lw~ indicates the amount of labour needed to produce one unit of wine/cheese. 

**Labour endowment** can be expressed as:
- L~w~ + L~c~ = L

**Production Possibility Set**:
- a~Lc~Q~c~ + a~Lw~Q~w~ <= L

**Production Possibility Frontier**:
- a~Lc~Q~c~ + a~Lw~Q~w~ = L

- slope~PPF~ = - (L/a~Lw~)/(L/a~Lc~) = -a~Lc~/a~Lw~

- OC~cheese~ = a~Lc~/a~Lw~, OC~wine~ = a~Lw~/a~Lc~


**Industry Equilibrium**:

Under perfect competition, firms maximise profit at $P = MC$, thus:
- P~c~ = a~Lc~wage~c~ => wage~c~ = P~c~/a~Lc~
- P~w~ = a~Lw~wage~cw~ => wage~w~ = P~w~/a~Lw~

If a country produces both goods with labour mobile across both sectors, in equilibrium, 
-  wage~w~ = wage~c = w, 
- P~c~/a~Lc~ = P~w~/a~Lw~, so
- **P~c~/P~w~ = a~Lc~/a~Lw~**, meaning that ==the relative price of cheese is equivalent to the opportunity cost of cheese.==

**Production Choice**
- If  **P~c~/P~w~ > a~Lc~/a~Lw~**, producers will specialise in producing cheese, thus Q~c~ = L/a~Lc~ and Q~w~ = 0.
- If **P~c~/P~w~ < a~Lc~/a~Lw~**, producers will specialise in producing wine, thus thus Q~w~ = L/a~Lw~ and Q~c~ = 0.
- If **P~c~/P~w~ = a~Lc~/a~Lw~** (wage~c~ = wage~w~), the autarky will produce both cheese and wine. Output levels are undetermined but will lie on the PPF.

**Relative Supply Function**
- If P~c~/P~w~ < a~Lc~/a~Lw~, Q~c~/Q~w~ = 0 and Q~c~ = 0.
- If P~c~/P~w~ = a~Lc~/a~Lw~, Q~c~/Q~w~ > 0 and 0 < Q~c~ < a~Lc~.
- If If P~c~/P~w~ > a~Lc~/a~Lw~, Q~c~/Q~w~ = &infin; and Q~c~ = L/a~Lc~.

**Consumer Choice**

The consumer takes prices and income as given and chooses consumptions, D~c~ and D~w~, to maximize a utility function U(D~c~, D~w~) expressing preferences.

- Income: 
$I = P_cD_c + P_wD_w$

- Demand: 
We assume that relative demand is a decreasing function of relative prices, like $\frac{D_c}{D_w}$= $2/\frac{P_c}{P_w}$.

**Autarky Equilibrium**

Autarky equilibrium price ratio: 
$P_c/P_w = OC_c = a_{Lc}/a_{Lw}$, when consumers always demand both goods and both goods are produced accordingly.

## Trade with Foriegn

**Assumptions**: 
Foreign: 
- $a^*_{Lw} = 2$ and $a^*_{Lc} = 3$.
- $L^* = L^*_w + L^*_c = 120$

Home:
- $a_{Lw} = 2$ and $a_{Lc} = 1$.
- $L = L_w + L_c = 120$
